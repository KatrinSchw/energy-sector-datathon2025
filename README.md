## Motivation

Even with the rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, **more than 90% of new vehicles sold in Q1 2025** still rely (at least partially) on gasoline.  
Gasoline remains one of the most critical energy commodities in the U.S. economy — both for consumers and policymakers.

Gasoline prices are:
- A **key economic indicator** reflecting supply-demand imbalances
- A **trigger for public sentiment** and political consequences
